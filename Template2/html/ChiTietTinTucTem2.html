                “Do you know that yesterday a man stopped me on the street because he thought I was American?” says Florencia, a
            character in Patricia Engel’s wistful, understated second collection of stories. “He said I had the same name as
            of one of Italy’s greatest cities. He said it was one of the most beautiful places in all of Europe, full of
            history and majesty. He said it suited me.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                That Florencia will never visit Italy, that she will never leave Cuba is not the point. What she wants is for
            her less-than-attentive husband to love her, and so she tries to impress him by cloaking herself in the glamour
            of distant countries; at the same time, her husband indulges in his own fantasy life, worshiping a young woman
            he drives for free in his taxi. She has her eye on a different prize: the chance to move to a magical city
            called San Diego.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Whether these dense stories are set in Cuba, Colombia or the United States, all the characters have
            astonishingly complex relationships to places they’ve never seen or haven’t been to in many years, since they
            emigrated to another place. Hence the title, “The Faraway World.”
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                In “The Book of Saints,” a young Colombian woman longs for Medellín, her hometown, while trapped in an arranged
            American marriage to a man who limits her access to money and friends. In “Campoamor,” a novelist flits between
            girlfriends and pretends to write a book while fearing an impending move from Havana to Miami, where the truth
            about his life may be revealed.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The richest, most heartbreaking stories come at the end of the collection. In “Libélula”, a domestic worker
            addresses her employer, a fellow Colombian, summoning the intimacies and degradations she has been forced to
            endure while running a household in America. Her responsibilities included comforting a wealthy housewife after
            a miscarriage by sleeping in her bed — “You would pay me extra, you said, and I told you there was no need” —
            and covering up her employer’s husband’s sexual advances, as well as watching cooking specials on TV so she can
            expand her repertoire beyond beans and rice; her employer calls this “peasant food.”
            </p>
            <br>
    
            <p>
                Finally she escapes, waiting for an afternoon when her employer is too drunk to notice. What makes this story so
            moving is how much love this woman shows her employer, how much patience and understanding. The effect is
            devastating and unforgettable, an emotional wallop in fewer than 16 pages.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Another standout is “Aguacero,” the final story, about a young woman who has been sexually assaulted by her
            boyfriend. When she meets Juan, who is 50, on the sidewalk in Manhattan, he immediately recognizes that Sara —
            not her real name, just one she gives him — is from Bogotá. (The giveaway: She uses her cigarette to hail a
            taxi.)
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Juan is also Colombian. When they develop a friendship, he reveals that he fled Colombia after being kidnapped.
            Though Sara refuses to share her crippling depression and fear of leaving her apartment, she does begin to meet
            Juan for coffee or a glass of wine. In small ways, these damaged, wary strangers find solace in each other.
            Years later, Sara looks back: “What stayed with me most was when Juan told me that even though people called him
            brave for having endured his imprisonment, he considered himself a coward because he hadn’t had the courage to
            try to escape.”
            </p>
            <br>
    
            <p>
                “The Faraway World” is a collection about the Latin American diaspora, but it’s also one that proves how Engel,
            like one of her characters, is capable of noticing that between any two people “a look reveals more than a
            fingerprint.”
